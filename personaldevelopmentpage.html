<h1> <font color="#fff" > My Summary of the Book</font></h1>
<p> The book begins with a sales rep and tells of his life where he has little time for his family
and is stuck in a sales job that he finds boring for the past 15 years.  His car breaks down
on his way to a sales meeting and he went to the nearest house to get some assistance as
he was without his phone. The house was a mansion that had 12 pillars. At the house he
meets an old guy that pretends he does not own the house and was just a worker on the
premises. It turns out that the yard guy was the actual owner of the home.
The book is about the relationship that develops between the yard guy and the sales rep
where they would meet each other over a series of months and the old man imparts life
lessons and useful advice to the sales rep and this is encapsulated in the principles of the
12 pillars which are summarized as follows:<br></br>

<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #1</font>:  The only way things are going to change for you is when you change. 
This pillar highlights the need to want to change so that things can actually change for the
better for a person.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #2:</font>  You should make sure that the outside of you is a good reflection of the
inside of you. 
This pillar emphasizes the importance of not only being physically healthy but also spiritualy
and emotionally healthy
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #3:</font>  Time, effort, and imagination must be summoned constantly to keep any
relationships flourishing and growing.
There is reflection here to suggest the important of nurturing relationships if we want them
to last.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #4:</font>  The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to
accomplish it.
The lesson imparted here is the need for converting dreams into goals and having a plan as
to how to achieve these tangible goals.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #5:</font>  Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.
This lesson speaks to the importance of having discipline to achieve goals, If there is no
discipline and you fail to achieve your goals then you will have regret which is always a
heavier burden to carry than discipline.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #6:</font>  Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and
the demands to perform are high.
Your attitude is greatly influenced by the people who you associate with. So you need to
associate with people that can encourage you and make you a better person. This is
important for personal growth.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #7:</font>  Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a
fortune.
Self-education is even more important than a formal education. IN order to grow we have to
keep learning.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #8:</font>  One key to having influence with others is to have others perceive you as a
person of talent and virtue.
 You can only influence others if you know what you are about, are sociable and carry
your-self at a certain standard.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #9:</font> What you become directly influences what you get.
The skills you develop to become wealthy is more important the than the wealth itself. You
can lose your wealth but rebuild it if you have the necessary skills. Income seldom exceeds
personal development.  To increase your wealth, you must increase your skills.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #10:</font> Communication is two or more people working together to find the
common ground of understanding.  And when they find that common ground, they
are positioned to have tremendous power together.
The foundation of success is great communication and team work. Commnication is not just
about talking but also about listening.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #11:</font>  To lead others is to help them change their thoughts, beliefs, and actions
for the better.
Leadership is a misunderstood concept.  Most people when they hear the term “great
leader” think of people who lead nations, corporations, or social movements.  Leadership
means you have mastered the art of influencing others. To lead others is to help them
change their thoughts, beliefs, and actions for the better. Sales and Leadership are
similar because they are both the art of influencing others.
When the sales guy goes to meet the old guy to learn the twelfth pillar, he finds out that he
is dead from the old man’s wife, and this is when he learns that he (the old man) was the
wealthy guy that owned the house and came up with the twelve pillars.  The final pillar,
number twelve is given to the sales guy by the wife in a letter from the old man.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Pillar #12:</font>  Live a life that will help others spiritually, intellectually, physically,
financially, and relationally. Live a life that serves as an example of what an
exceptional life can look like.
<br></br>
<font color="#7ED5EA" > Lessons learnt:</font>
You cannot choose how long you will live, but you can choose how well you live. You can
also help others along the way and when you help others that is when you will build a
legacy.  Helping others and giving to others is what life is really about and when you are
dead and gone, be remembered for what you did for others and not what you have. I feel that this lesson will help me to 
be more helpful to others and i will use this knowlege to build a legacy of kindness and respect.</p>
